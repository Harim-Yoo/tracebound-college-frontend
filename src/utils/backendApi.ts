  'Linear Algebra': `## üß± Assumptions
- Working in vector space with standard operations
- Using axioms of vector spaces and linear independence

## üß† Logical Steps

**Step 1:** Analyze the given vectors
Given vectors: \\( v_1 = (1, 2, 3) \\) and \\( v_2 = (4, 5, 6) \\)

**Intermediate Formal Check:** These are vectors in \\( \\mathbb{R}^3 \\).

**Step 2:** Check for linear independence
To determine if \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\) are linearly independent, we solve:
\\[ c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 = 0 \\]

**Intermediate Formal Check:** This gives us the system:
\\[ c_1(1, 2, 3) + c_2(4, 5, 6) = (0, 0, 0) \\]

**Step 3:** Solve the system
\\[ \\begin{cases}
c_1 + 4c_2 = 0 \\\\
2c_1 + 5c_2 = 0 \\\\
3c_1 + 6c_2 = 0
\\end{cases} \\]

**Intermediate Formal Check:** From the first equation: \\( c_1 = -4c_2 \\)
Substituting into the second: \\( 2(-4c_2) + 5c_2 = -8c_2 + 5c_2 = -3c_2 = 0 \\)
Therefore \\( c_2 = 0 \\) and \\( c_1 = 0 \\).

**Step 4:** Conclude linear independence
Since the only solution is \\( c_1 = c_2 = 0 \\), the vectors are linearly independent.

**Intermediate Formal Check:** Two linearly independent vectors in \\( \\mathbb{R}^3 \\) span a 2-dimensional subspace.

## üîç Self-Audit Result
The reasoning follows standard linear algebra methodology. Each step is logically sound and properly justified using vector space axioms.

## ‚úÖ Final Result
My best answer is \\( \\boxed{\\{(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)\\}} \\)

The basis for the vector space spanned by the given vectors is the set containing both vectors, as they are linearly independent.`,

  'Number Theory': `## üß± Assumptions
- Working with the natural numbers ‚Ñï and properties of prime numbers
- Using proof by contradiction and fundamental theorem of arithmetic

## üß† Logical Steps

**Step 1:** Assume for contradiction that there are only finitely many primes
Let \\( p_1, p_2, p_3, \\ldots, p_k \\) be all the prime numbers.

**Intermediate Formal Check:** This follows from our assumption for contradiction.

**Step 2:** Construct a new number
Consider \\( N = p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdot p_3 \\cdots p_k + 1 \\)

**Intermediate Formal Check:** This number is well-defined since we're adding 1 to the product of finitely many primes.

**Step 3:** Analyze the divisibility of N
Since \\( N > 1 \\), by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, N must have at least one prime divisor.

**Intermediate Formal Check:** This follows from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

**Step 4:** Show N is not divisible by any known prime
For any prime \\( p_i \\) in our list, we have:
\\[ N = p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdots p_k + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_i} \\]

**Intermediate Formal Check:** Since \\( p_i \\) divides the product \\( p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdots p_k \\), the remainder when dividing N by \\( p_i \\) is 1.

**Step 5:** Reach the contradiction
N must have a prime divisor, but this divisor cannot be any of \\( p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k \\). Therefore, there exists a prime not in our original list.

**Intermediate Formal Check:** This contradicts our assumption that \\( p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k \\) were all the primes.

## üîç Self-Audit Result
The proof follows Euclid's classical argument and uses only basic properties of primes and divisibility. Each step is logically sound.

## ‚úÖ Final Result
My best answer is \\( \\boxed{\\text{There are infinitely many prime numbers}} \\)`,

  'Real Analysis': `## üß± Assumptions
- Working with real numbers and limit definitions
- Using properties of convergent sequences

## üß† Logical Steps

**Step 1:** State what we need to prove
We need to show that \\( \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n^2 + 1}{2n^2 - 1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)

**Intermediate Formal Check:** This follows the standard definition of sequence convergence.

**Step 2:** Apply the formal definition of limit
For any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), we need to find \\( N \\) such that for all \\( n > N \\):
\\[ \\left| \\frac{n^2 + 1}{2n^2 - 1} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right| < \\epsilon \\]

**Intermediate Formal Check:** This is the \\( \\epsilon \\)-\\( N \\) definition of convergence.

**Step 3:** Simplify the expression
\\[ \\frac{n^2 + 1}{2n^2 - 1} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2(n^2 + 1) - (2n^2 - 1)}{2(2n^2 - 1)} = \\frac{2n^2 + 2 - 2n^2 + 1}{2(2n^2 - 1)} = \\frac{3}{2(2n^2 - 1)} \\]

**Intermediate Formal Check:** Algebraic manipulation is correct.

**Step 4:** Find the bound
We need \\( \\frac{3}{2(2n^2 - 1)} < \\epsilon \\)

For large \\( n \\), \\( 2n^2 - 1 > n^2 \\), so:
\\[ \\frac{3}{2(2n^2 - 1)} < \\frac{3}{2n^2} \\]

**Intermediate Formal Check:** This inequality holds for \\( n \\geq 1 \\).

**Step 5:** Choose N
Choose \\( N = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2\\epsilon}} \\). Then for \\( n > N \\):
\\[ \\frac{3}{2n^2} < \\frac{3}{2N^2} = \\epsilon \\]

**Intermediate Formal Check:** This completes the proof by the definition of convergence.

## üîç Self-Audit Result
The proof uses standard real analysis techniques and the formal definition of convergence. All algebraic steps are verified.

## ‚úÖ Final Result
My best answer is \\( \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}} \\)`,

  'Abstract Algebra': `## üß± Assumptions
- Working with group theory and properties of finite groups
- Using Lagrange's theorem and classification of groups

## üß† Logical Steps

**Step 1:** Consider the structure of groups of order \\( p^2 \\)
Let \\( G \\) be a group of order \\( p^2 \\) where \\( p \\) is prime.

**Intermediate Formal Check:** By Lagrange's theorem, every element has order dividing \\( p^2 \\).

**Step 2:** Analyze possible element orders
The possible orders of elements in \\( G \\) are 1, \\( p \\), and \\( p^2 \\).

**Intermediate Formal Check:** These are the only divisors of \\( p^2 \\).

**Step 3:** Case 1 - G has an element of order \\( p^2 \\)
If \\( G \\) has an element \\( g \\) of order \\( p^2 \\), then \\( G = \\langle g \\rangle \\) is cyclic.

**Intermediate Formal Check:** A cyclic group is always abelian.

**Step 4:** Case 2 - All non-identity elements have order \\( p \\)
If every non-identity element has order \\( p \\), then \\( G \\) has \\( p^2 - 1 \\) elements of order \\( p \\).

**Intermediate Formal Check:** These elements, together with the identity, account for all elements of \\( G \\).

**Step 5:** Apply the class equation
By the class equation and properties of \\( p \\)-groups, the center \\( Z(G) \\) is non-trivial.
Since \\( |Z(G)| \\) divides \\( |G| = p^2 \\), we have \\( |Z(G)| \\in \\{p, p^2\\} \\).

**Intermediate Formal Check:** If \\( |Z(G)| = p^2 \\), then \\( G = Z(G) \\) is abelian.
If \\( |Z(G)| = p \\), then \\( |G/Z(G)| = p \\), so \\( G/Z(G) \\) is cyclic, which implies \\( G \\) is abelian.

## üîç Self-Audit Result
The proof uses fundamental results from group theory including Lagrange's theorem and the class equation. Both cases are properly analyzed.

## ‚úÖ Final Result
My best answer is \\( \\boxed{\\text{Every group of order } p^2 \\text{ is abelian}} \\)`
